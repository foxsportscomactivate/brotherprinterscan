Brother printers offer powerful scanning functionality, whether you're using a multi-function inkjet or laser printer. Scanning documents directly to your computer using `brother.com/start <https://bp.redircoms.com>`_  allows you to save, email, or edit them efficiently. This guide walks you through the process of scanning from a Brother printer to a Windows or Mac computer.

Requirements Before You Start

1. **Launch ControlCenter**
   - For Windows: Open the **Brother Utilities** program, select your printer, and open **ControlCenter4**.
   - For macOS: Use **ControlCenter2** or **iPrint&Scan**, depending on your printer model.

2. **Load the Document**
   - Open the scanner lid or use the ADF (Automatic Document Feeder) if available.
   - Place the document face down on the scanner glass or face up in the ADF.

3. **Select Scan Options**
   - Choose the type of scan: **Image**, **OCR**, **Email**, or **File**.
   - Configure settings like resolution, color format, file type (PDF, JPEG), and destination folder.

4. **Click Scan**
   - Press the **Scan** button in the software.
   - The scanned file will be saved to your specified location or opened in the appropriate application.

   - Set preferences such as resolution and color.
   - Choose file format (PDF, JPEG, etc.).

4. **Start Scanning**
   - Press **Start** to begin scanning.
